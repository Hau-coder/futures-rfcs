# Futures RFCs

Much like Rust's [RFC repo](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs), this repository houses RFCs related to futures. RFCs should follow the [Rust RFC template](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/0000-template.md) and be proposed via pull requests to this repository.

Decisions will ultimately rest on consensus of the futures core team:

- @alexcrichton
- @carllerche
- @cramertj
- @aturon
